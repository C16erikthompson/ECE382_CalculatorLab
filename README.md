Calculator in assembly

#Step 1: Pseudocode

To begin the process of creating the calculator, I created some psuedocode that described the way in which I would complete each objective for full functionality.  While this should have been done in a more modular, segmented sort of way, the psuedocode I created here was sufficient in providing me guidance as I worked through my coding.  I must be sure to create a more appropriate diagram next time I create pseudocode.  Flow chart appears below:
